# [Keep your Tabs to Yourself](/keep-your-tabs-to-yourself)

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an amazing tool. I've used it for years and will continue to do so, but [I find shit like this beyond eyeroll inducing](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1541761871585464323). Because there's an accessibility angle now the vast majority of JS/TS devs might have **tabs** as the default? The point of a default is that it fits the default use case.

I've never bothered with a config file for Prettier before. Now I'll be dropping a `.prettierrc` like this at the root of all my projects:
```json
{
  "useTabs": false
}
```
