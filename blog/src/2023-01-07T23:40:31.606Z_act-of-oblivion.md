I absolutely loved Robert Harris's latest novel, [**_Act of Oblivion_**](https://www.amazon.com/Act-Oblivion-Novel-Robert-Harris/dp/006324800X). A historical novel set in the 17th century, it covers the hunt for two former Parliamentary army officers who had been signatories to King Charles I's death sentence. After the restoration of the monarchy they flee England to avoid being charged with treason. Their destination is New England. At first, the distance from power helps, but the reach of the vengeful is vast and they cannot escape their past for long.

At times this novel has the thrills of a chase story like _The Fugitive_, but what really had me loving it was the quiet moments of reflection sprinkled throughout. One of the regicides in particular, Edward Whalley, is able to truly question both his own past actions, as well as those of the Cromwellian dictatorship more broadly. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that he ends up recognizing that moderation, religous tolerance, and democracy are actually the underpinnings of a truly free society, and that all are ideals that Republican England fell well short of. (And, perhaps, they're ideals that the modern United Kingdom or United States fall short of too?)

Anyone interested in historical fiction and/or a meditation on _executive_ versus _democratic_ power is going to be absolutely enthralled by this novel.
