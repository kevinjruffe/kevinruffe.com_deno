 I'm hearing a lot of pessimism coming from friends, family and neighbors lately about the future. And I'm talking about people with a variety of political positions here. They don't agree on what the problems are, let alone how to fix them, but they all seem to agree that *something* is wrong.

I tend to see things a little differently. I don't deny there are things happening in this country that I don't agree with, but on balance I tend to think the world is becoming a better place, and for every thing we can quibble about with our country's direction there's a couple other metrics we can point to where things are improving.

Good to get some validation then in [**The Interpreter** column](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/world/interpreter-world-falling-apart.html) in *The New York Times* this morning. In it, Max Fisher writes pretty persuasively that while democratic erosion in the States and elsewhere is a big concern, there are so many other trends worth celebrating right now. Cheers to that. üçª
