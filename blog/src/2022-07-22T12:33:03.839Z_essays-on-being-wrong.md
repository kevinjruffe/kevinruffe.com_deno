I woke up to an interesting feature in *The New York Times* this morning. The **Opinion** section led with a [series of editorials](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/21/opinion/nyt-columnists-i-was-wrong.html) from *Times* columnists in which the columnists ruminated on a policy position or political stance they'd gotten wrong. I was absolutely delighted by it. Afterall, it's clich√© to say we learn best from our mistakes for the simple reason that *it's true*.

In their writing I could really see some of these columnists wrestling with their past beliefs in ways I too found enlightening. Brooks, Krugman and Stephens, in particular, really seemed to take the exercise seriously. (Gail Collins, on the other hand, seems to have found it an oppurtunity for a throwaway piece with a humurous tone...)

It would be great to see this become a recurring feature. Say, on a perhaps, annual or bi-annual basis.

**A final note:** the animated opening of the digital edition, with typos as metaphor, was a clever touch. üëçüëç
