# [CNBC's Ten Best States to Live](/cnbc's-ten-best-states-to-live)
<div class=post-date>Saturday, July 16, 2022</div>

Since 2007 [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/) has been ranking all 50 states in the US by how good they are to do business in. As you can imagine, the Northeast doesn't always rank that highly. We have high taxes, lots of regulations, the region has a shrinking workforce, the high cost of living means needing to pay larger salaries, etc. However, as part of compiling this list *CNBC* checks a bunch of different attributes and in some of those the Northeast really does shine. Things like educated workforce, access to capital, tech innovation and so on.

One of those criteria where the Northeast also does great is apparently *quality of life*. With the data they've compiled *CNBC* puts together a side list covering their [10 Best States to Live In 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/14/these-10-states-are-americas-best-places-to-live-in-2022.html) and no shock to me, Vermont (my home) and Maine (my second favorite state) are right in the #1 and #2 spots! Low crime, protections for all people, access to voting rights, great healthcare and childcare, an unspoiled envrironment, all come together put us at the top.

So glad to call Vermont, and New England more generally, home. üè°
