I've no love for either big party in federal US politics. I have points of agreement with both, I've voted for candidates from both, but I have little respect for both. I suspect one reason I don't see many candidates I can quickly support from either is a need for them to go to the extremes in order to secure their base.

I don't necessarily see what NJ Congressman Tom Malinowski presents in [this piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/opinion/moderate-party-new-jersey.html) as offering a silver bullet for our national polarlization. (I have other ideas as to what might mitigate that.) I do, however, think he's on to something with regard to how we can mitigate political animosity and vote in folks who could get things done in DC. And I suspect I'd be at least open to supporting a politician of either big party (grudgingly, no doubt) who also had the endorsement of some **Moderate Party**.
