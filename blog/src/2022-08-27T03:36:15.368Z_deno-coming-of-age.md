# [Deno Coming of Age](/deno-coming-of-age)
<div class=post-date>Friday, August 26, 2022</div>

Deno just announced what amounts to a [massive upgrade](https://deno.com/blog/changes):

> We've been working on some updates that will allow Deno to easily import npm packages and make the vast majority of npm packages work in Deno within the next three months.<br> Our goal is to make Deno the fastest JavaScript runtime. For starters, the next release of Deno will include a new HTTP server. It is the fastest JavaScript web server ever built.

## My Usage

It's been a bit since I've had the chance to leverage [Deno](https://deno.land/). Last time I used it professionally was for a validation script. The script confirmed I'd successfuly combined a MySQL and a PostgreSQL database together without data loss. At the time (a year and a half back) I'd really liked using Deno, but I knew I couldn't bring it into a production codebase.

## Is Deno Ready to Replace Node in '22?

Almost? I think it hinges on how well Ryan and the team behind Deno executes on [the announcments made](https://deno.com/blog/changes) this month. If *"80-90% of npm packages work in Deno within the next three months"* and Deno really does, in practice, have the HTTP Server performance mentioned [here](https://deno.com/blog/v1.25#new-experimental-http-server-api), then I think we're going to see a huge wave of adoption.

Honestly, I'm excited enough about this that I'm considering rewriting my [brand new static-blog generator](https://github.com/kevinjruffe/kevinruffe.com) in Deno. ðŸ¦•
