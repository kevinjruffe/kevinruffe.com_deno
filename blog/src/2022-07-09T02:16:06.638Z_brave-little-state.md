My wife Katie and I are big fans of [the Brave Little State podcast](https://www.vermontpublic.org/podcast/brave-little-state) from [Vermont Public](https://www.vermontpublic.org/) (formerly _Vermont Public Radio_). It's a great show where listeners get to vote on listener-submitted questions that they'd like answered by Vermont Public's reporters. Given our love for the show, you can imagine our delight when a question of Katie's got selected, albeit through the backdoor. Who needs votes? One of the show producers selected it as a wildcard pick! üòÅ

[The episode](https://www.vermontpublic.org/podcast/brave-little-state/2022-07-07/brave-little-states-5th-annual-brief-history-of-vermont-road-names) just landed this week. Katie's question was: **Whose job is it to come up with the punny messages on the highway traffic alert signs throughout Vermont? Hilarious!**
